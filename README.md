## Project Overview
This project provides a Social Media Analytics Microservice that includes both the backend and frontend components.

The backend is built using Node.js and Express.js, which fetches data from a test social media platform API and provides endpoints for fetching users, posts, and comments.

The frontend is built with React.js and provides a UI to interact with the backend and display analytics and data to the users.


## Key Features

2. Fetch Posts for a User: Get all posts made by a specific user.
3. Fetch Comments for a Post: Get all comments made on a specific post.
4. Bearer Token Authentication: Secure API requests with a Bearer token for authentication.
5. Caching: Implemented caching to reduce unnecessary API calls and improve performance.

### Frontend:
1. Displays the top users, their posts, and comments.
2. Interactive UI with dynamic updates.
